## Project Summary

The Query Routes project is a web application designed to simplify the travel process for users. It integrates detailed information from various transportation agencies to provide comprehensive solutions for commuters. The application offers a range of features, including real-time transit updates, journey planners, price estimates, service alerts, and user account functionalities.

One of the standout features of this application is its commitment to providing efficient and sustainable transportation solutions for the city of SÃ£o Paulo. Additionally, it displays nearby tourist spots and hospitals at each stop, adding an extra layer of convenience for users.

We also plan to incorporate visualizations depicting the availability of transportation facilities in rural areas. This feature not only provides insights into rural transit options but also serves as a valuable statistic for improving local rides.
